Activity Title: Mastering Git with a Java To-Do List Application

Description: 
In this activity, you will enhance a Java console-based To-Do List application by adding new features while mastering advanced Git commands. You will create separate branches for each feature, manage merges, resolve conflicts, and practice using git stash for handling uncommitted changes. The goal is to develop your understanding of branch management, merging, and effective use of Git tools.

Objectives:

1. Create and manage branches for new features.
2. Implement new features in a collaborative development environment.
3. Resolve merge conflicts effectively.
4. Utilize git stash for managing uncommitted changes.
5. Visualize branch history and changes using GitLens.
